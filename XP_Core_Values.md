# Extreme Programming (XP) Core Values

## Communication

Our team's capacity for communication was one of its greatest strengths. The best kind of communication, in our view, is face-to-face communication.
As a consequence, we all sit one on one in same room for the crucial sessions, removing any barriers to communication.
Additionally, on Mondays and Tuesdays of every week, our team held scrum meetings.During the call, we spoke about our progress and dealt with issues with dependency and other obstacles. In order to oversee the project and keep track of our user stories,we used Project Dashboard - Jira .This allowed us to track the progress of several tasks during the sprint. We decided to take on duties based on our individual strengths and to support one another by collaborating frequently via Google Meet meetings. During the meetings, any issues or problems were routinely aired.

## Simplicity

The most crucial components of the scope of the project were identified using a critical eye, and we only finished the necessary tasks.
We actively worked to remove duplications when we introduced additional APIs and corresponding UI components, which helped us keep our code easy to maintain.We ensured that all class names, method names, and local variables were unambiguous and indicated the objective.

## Feedback

We believe in feedback. We have given valuable feedback to the team to create a better product. After every development item is 
completed, the team gave feedback on the delivered item for changes/suggestions. We also tested features made by other team members and 
provided comments to each other during the testing process. It aided us in locating the bugs.

## Respect

Everyone was considerate of the time, efforts and views of the other team members. 
During the process of selecting technological stacks, team members acknowledged each other's viewpoints and ideas. 
Everyone politely agreed on the technologies chosen by a majority vote, and committed to study and develop the necessary abilities 
to put them into practice. When a group member experienced an unexpected challenge, all of us were empathetic and polite, and everyone 
volunteered to make and solve the situation.
