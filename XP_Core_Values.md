# Extreme Programming (XP) Core Values

## Communication

One of our team's greatest assets was its ability to communicate. We believed that face to face conversation is the best communication. 
So, for the important meetings as a team we sit together in the same space without barriers to communication. 
And also our team held scrum meetings every week on Wednesday and Saturday. 
We discussed our progress and dealt with dependence concerns and other roadblocks during the call. To keep track of our user stories and manage the project, 
we used Project Dashboard.This allowed us to track the progress of several tasks during the sprint. We chose to take on responsibilities 
based on our unique strengths and to aid each other by interacting on a regular basis through Zoom meetings. Any problems or 
issues were routinely discussed during the meetings.

## Simplicity

We used a critical eye to determine the most important aspects of the project scope and only did what was required. 
As we introduced new APIs and matching UI components, actively striving to eliminate duplications helped us keep our code simple to maintain. 
We made sure that the names of all classes, methods, and variables were explicit and disclosed the goal.

## Feedback

We believe in feedback. We have given valuable feedback to the team to create a better product. After every development item is 
completed, the team gave feedback on the delivered item for changes/suggestions. We also tested features made by other team members and 
provided comments to each other during the testing process. It aided us in locating the bugs.

## Respect

Everyone was considerate of the time, efforts and views of the other team members. 
During the process of selecting technological stacks, team members acknowledged each other's viewpoints and ideas. 
Everyone politely agreed on the technologies chosen by a majority vote, and committed to study and develop the necessary abilities 
to put them into practice. When a group member experienced an unexpected challenge, all of us were empathetic and polite, and everyone 
volunteered to make and solve the situation.
